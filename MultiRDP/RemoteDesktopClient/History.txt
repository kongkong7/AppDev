Full Release / April 2 
NEW: - From the requests of Simon Capewell and shmulyeng - Simon Capewell Requests: 
--- DONE(03222009_1254)1. Allow connection to servers on a specific port using AdvancedSettings2.RDPPort 
--- DONE(03192009_0916)2. More screen resolutions on the slider - most obviously 1152x864 and 1280x1024. 
--- DONE(03202009_1341)3. Context menu on the list of servers. 
--- DONE(03222009_1254)4. Options for different icon sizes for the list of servers. 
--- DONE(03227009_0138)5. Groupings for servers - handy if you have lots of clients each of whom have multiple servers. You could launch sessions for all the items in the group. 
--- DONE(03212009_1321)6. Auto hide or view menu option to show/hide the sidebar (similar to Visual Studio). 
--- DONE(03192009_0200)7. Clicking Delete Server or Edit Settings when there are no servers throws an exception. 

--- Here's another one that's just occurred. I use Launchy to index a directory with a load of .rdp files in it, which means I can just type Ctrl+space then a portion of the server name and launch it. To do that with this tool it'd need to: 
--- DONE(03272009_1129)1. Be able to launch a connection from the built in server list from the command line. 
--- DONE(03272009_1129)2. Have a command line switch to open the connection in an existing instance of the app. 
--- DONE(03272009_1129)3. Perhaps even be able to launch connections from the command line using rdp files rather than the built in server list. 
- shmulyeng requests: 
--- DONE(03272009_0252)Ability to password protect the server list. 
--- DONE(03202009_1341)Ability to right click on a connection item in the list to edit connection details. 
--- (WILL TRY) Ability to log out of a connection rather than disconnect. 
--- DONE(03212009_1321)One thing I like about Palantir is the tabs of open connections. 
- and I added some 
- CAPTCHA verfication on startup password. 
--- When an incorrrect password is entered 3x, CAPTCH verification panel will show up.
- SQLite3
--- scrap XML!! :P
